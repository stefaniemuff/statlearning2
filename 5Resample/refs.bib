  abstract = {Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) continue to grow in popularity
	due to their ability to directly acknowledge multiple levels of dependency
	and model different data types. For small sample sizes especially,
	likelihood-based inference can be unreliable with variance components
	being particularly difficult to estimate. A Bayesian approach is
	appealing but has been hampered by the lack of a fast implementation,
	and the difficulty in specifying prior distributions with variance
	components again being particularly problematic. Here, we briefly
	review previous approaches to computation in Bayesian implementations
	of GLMMs and illustrate in detail, the use of integrated nested Laplace
	approximations in this context. We consider a number of examples,
	carefully specifying prior distributions on meaningful quantities
	in each case. The examples cover a wide range of data types including
	those requiring smoothing over time and a relatively complicated
	spline model for which we examine our prior specification in terms
	of the implied degrees of freedom. We conclude that Bayesian inference
	is now practically feasible for GLMMs and provides an attractive
	alternative to likelihood-based approaches such as penalized quasi-likelihood.
	As with likelihood-based approaches, great care is required in the
	analysis of clustered binary data since approximation strategies
	may be less accurate for such data.},

	is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases
	in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation

	the Bayesian method, which is applied to the functional relationship
	situation in Section 3: it is shown that the asymptotic behaviour
	of the distributions exhibits a novel form. In Section 4 the posterior
	distributions derived in Section 3 are considered in more detail:
	in particular, a standard error for the estimate of slope is provided.
	Section 5 contains various comments on the method, and, in particular,
	indicates other fields of application.},

  abstract = {For bivariate meta-analysis of diagnostic studies, likelihood approaches
	are very popular. However, they often run into numerical problems
	with possible non-convergence. In addition, the construction of confidence
	intervals is controversial. Bayesian methods based on Markov chain
	Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling could be used, but are often difficult
	to implement, and require long running times and diagnostic convergence
	checks. Recently, a new Bayesian deterministic inference approach
	for latent Gaussian models using integrated nested Laplace approximations
	(INLA) has been proposed. With this approach MCMC sampling becomes
	redundant as the posterior marginal distributions are directly and
	accurately approximated. By means of a real data set we investigate
	the influence of the prior information provided and compare the results
	obtained by INLA, MCMC, and the maximum likelihood procedure SAS
	PROC NLMIXED. Using a simulation study we further extend the comparison
	of INLA and SAS PROC NLMIXED by assessing their performance in terms
	of bias, mean-squared error, coverage probability, and convergence
	rate. The results indicate that INLA is more stable and gives generally
	better coverage probabilities for the pooled estimates and less biased
	estimates of variance parameters. The user-friendliness of INLA is
	demonstrated by documented R-code. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley

	assumptions on the random effects precision parameters is a potential
	problem. To quantify the sensitivity to prior assumptions, we develop
	a general sensitivity measure based on the Hellinger distance to
	assess sensitivity of the posterior distributions with respect to
	changes in the prior distributions for the precision parameters.
	In addition, for model selection we suggest several cross-validatory
	techniques for Bayesian GLMMs with a dichotomous outcome. Although
	the proposed methodology holds in greater generality, we make use
	of the developed methods in the particular context of the well-known
	salamander mating data. We arrive at various new findings with re-
	spect to the best fitting model and the sensitivity of the estimates
	of the model components.},
