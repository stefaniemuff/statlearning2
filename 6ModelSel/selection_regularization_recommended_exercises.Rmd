# Recommended exercise 1

1. Show that the least square estimator of a standard linear model is given by
$$ \hat{\boldsymbol \beta} =(\boldsymbol X^T \boldsymbol X)^{-1} \boldsymbol X^T \boldsymbol Y$$
2. Show that the maximum likelihood estimator is equal to the least square estimator for the standard linear model.

# Recommended exercise 2

Write R code to create a similar representation of the Credit data figure shown below.

# Recommended exercise 3

1. For the Credit Dataset, pick the best model using Best Subset Selection according to $C_p$, $BIC$ and Adjusted $R^2$
    + Hint: Use the `regsubsets()` of the `leaps` library, similar to what was done in Lab 1 of the book.
2. For the Credit Dataset, pick the best model using Best Subset Selection according to a $10$-fold CV
    + Hint: Use the output obtained in the previous step and build your own CV function to pick the best model.
3. Compare the result obtained in Step 1 and Step 2.

# Recommended exercise 4

1. Select the best model for the Credit Data using Forward, Backward and Hybrid (sequential replacement) Stepwise Selection.
    + Hint: Use the `regsubsets()` of the `leaps` library
2. Compare with the results obtained with Best Subset Selection.

# Recommended exercise 5

1. Apply Ridge regression to the Credit Dataset.
2. Compare the results with the standard linear regression.

# Recommended exercise 6

1. Apply Lasso regression to the Credit Dataset.
2. Compare the results with the standard linear regression and the Ridge regression.

# Recommended exercise 7

How many principal components should we use for the Credit Dataset? Justify? 

# Recommended exercise 8

Apply PCR on the Credit dataset and compare the results with the previous methods used in this module.

# Recommended exercise 9

Apply PLS on the Credit dataset and compare the results with the previous methods used in this module.
