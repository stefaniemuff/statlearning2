Reference group TMA4268

Second meeting: March 02, 2020, 9:00-9:45, office 1040 in Sentralbygg 2
Present: Andreas Matre (Bachelor Math 3rd year), John Lau (other study program), Stefanie Muff (Course coordinator)
Missing due to illness: Sara Elise WÃ¸llo (Industrial Mathematics 4th year)


1. We started with an introductory round to collect broad thought of the students. John mentions that watching the online videos before class really helps him to get the most out of the lectures. Idea: Could recommend this for next year to get more into a "Flipped classroom" setup.

2. Steffi asks if there is a desire for more interactive components in the lectures. 
- Andreas brings up that this may depend very much on the students. Many don't answer when we have a discussion (in fact, it is mostly the same 2-3 that raise their hand during class), so he's not sure if there is a desire for more interactive components.
- Steffi said it could also mean that we solve some exercises and then discuss interactively.
- Both students agree that the usefulness of interactive components depends on amount of the material that is to be covered. It only makes sense if it's no rush.
- In summary, it might be nice to have a bit more interactions.

3. Steffi asks why the reference group thinks there are so few coming to the supervised exercise classes on Thursday mornings. There are probably several aspects
- Mainly, the students prioritize course components that are graded, so many do not invest in recommended (but non-compulsory) exercises.  
- Also, 8-to am in the morning is somewhat bad (unattractive) time.
- In the same context, it was mentioned that it's useful to have solutions early (as it is done), because this helps to self-check immediately, even though the danger is that one checks too early, without really thinking. Steffi agrees, but also thinks solutions should be given early, and students should have the learning competence to consult them when it fits best.
- Sara also sends the feedback (by email) that the exercise sheets are perceived as being too long. The students don't know on which questions they should focus. Either we should point out which are the relevant exercise problems, or then shorten the sheets.

4. Steffi wanted to know what the students think about the size and depth of compulsory 1.
- The size was good.
- The level was also ok. 
We agree that compulsory 2 should be held in a similar fashion. 

5. Steffi asks if the level of mathematical depth is too shallow, since the course covers so many different topics. Is there a problem?
- Andreas says that perhaps some students want more math background
- However, it is clearly perceived as an applied course that gives an overview over many modern statistical learning topics, thus the level is ok.
- It would be good to link the "Elements of statistical learning" book on the course web page, so it's clear where to find more details for those that are interested.

6. Other feedback?
- Some students think the slides are a bit too full, and that a bit more on the blackboard would help to slow down.
- Steffi agrees, but also brings up that the students could bring the slides (printed or on their device) and add hand notes during class, so they can concentrate on the content without needing to copy too many things from the board. 
- An idea is to leave some slides blank, so the students could directly use those to add some derivations or thoughts.   
- Steffi takes this up and tries (for next year at least) to do a bit more on the board and to make the slides a bit less dense.
- However, John brings in that the slides should still be "complete", so that students can in principle learn from them.


In summary, the reference group agrees that the course is running well and that students are happy.

Final comment: The final meeting with the reference group will be held after the exam.
