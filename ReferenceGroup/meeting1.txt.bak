Reference group TMA4268

First meeting: January 13, 2020, 9:30-10:00, office 1040 in Sentralbygg 2
Present: Sara Elise WÃ¸llo (Industrial Mathematics 4th year), Andreas Matre (Bachelor Math 3rd year), John Lau (other study program), Stefanie Muff (Course coordinator)


1. Welcoming: We said hi, and Steffi thanked the students for their willingness to be in the reference groupe.

2. Compulsory exercises: We first talked about compulsory exercise 2, which was now shifted to a different time slot in the course, because many students will be on an excursion around the easter break. The students mentioned that one problem is that there are many projects at the same time, especially in the 3rd year of mathematics. Steffi agreed that this was not so good, and that we could for another year think about a somewhat different planning. For example, we could have both projects 1-2 weeks earlier. The students also said that the projects should not be too big. Last year they were apparently too big. Althoug they were not really difficult, there war too many questions and sub-questions. So Steffi suggests to have 1 question per module, with maybe a)-c) or a)-d), instead of having 10 questions with a)-h) or similar. The students also wish that the projects contain material that is relevant for the curriculum, and should not cover additional material that is not relevant for the exam. Steffi explains that this will be the case, and that they will need to run R, which is complementary (and in contrast) to the exam.

3. Motivation to take the course: Steffi asked the group about their motivation to take TMA4268. They all mentioned that the wanted to get some practical experience and work with actual data. John also said that he wanted to learn about when to apply the different models and how to validate them. All agreed that interest lies not just in theory, but really linking theory to practical applications. Sara metioned that she heard the course was useful, with focus on applications. Also, they heard that the course was fun and useful for real-life, e.g. when taking on a job later. 

4. Lecture style: Steffi asked about preferences in course style, and all students said they like more interactive components (but it "depends" - there must be enough time). Thei are also ok with group work, in particular for the graded exercises. To form the groups, the students had the idea that it should be allowed that students write me an email if they need a partner for the project, so I can then try to match students together. 

Finally, Steffi mentioned that anybody can contact her at any time if things are unclear. Otherwise we will have the next meeting after the compulsory exercise 1 project.
