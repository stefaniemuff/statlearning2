Dear all - the exam is now in less than 3 weeks - and I trust you have started to prepare!

Important: 

You need to bring your laptop
You need to have the latest version of Safe Exam Browser (SEB) installed. 
Go through the test exam to check that your installation is working.
Linux, android, iOS or ChromeOS are not supported: fill in form to ask for load pc if needed.
Nice: your exam paper is available to you after the exam.

The SEB will make sure that you may only access Inspera - and not any other programmes on your machine or on Internet. This means that R and R Studio will not be available to you at the exam.

Here is a picture of the information sheet of the exam:

2) Supervision before the exam

Anything you wonder about? Mette is available for one-on-one questions (nothing in plenum) in room 734, 7.etg. sentralbygg 2 on
Monday May 13 at 10.15-12
Monday May 20 at 12.15-14 
Wednesday May 22 at 12.15-14

You may also email Mette if you have urgent questions, and Mette will post on Bb if there are common themes in emails or at the supervision sessions that all should know about. 
There is no need to come to the supervision session if you do not have questions.

3) Preparing for the exam

The best is to use Module 12 to prepare - here all module resources are linked in and suitable examples and problems are listed for each topic. https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/TMA4268/2019v/12Final/12Final.html

Also remember that the textbook is very readable - expecially if you focus on understanding and philosophy.
