# Recommended exercise 1

- For the New York Times stories dataset:
    - Create a biplot and explain the type of information that you can extract from the plot.
    - Create plots for the PVE and Cumulative PVE. Describe what type of information you can extract from the plots.
    
The pca-examples.rdata can be downloaded from the Blackboard. 

# Recommended exercise 2

Show that the algorithm below is guaranteed to decrease the value of the objective

$$\underset{C_1, \ldots, C_k}{\text{minimize}}\left\{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{1}{|C_k|} \sum_{i, i' \in C_k} \sum_{j=1}^{p}(x_{ij} - x_{i'j})^2 \right\}$$

at each step.
