$~$

Loadings vectors $\Phi_i=(\Phi_{1j} , \Phi_{2j},\ldots, \Phi_{pj})^\top$: How much does the respective covariate contribute to PC$_j$?

### Example from Compulsory 3, 2020

$~$

* We study the `decathlon2` dataset from the `factoextra` package in R, where Athletes' performance during a sporting meeting was recorded. 

* We look at 23 athletes and the results from the 10 disciplines in two competitions.

```{r,eval=T,echo=F}
library(factoextra)
library(FactoMineR)
data("decathlon2")
decathlon2.active <- decathlon2[1:23, 1:10]
names(decathlon2.active) <- c("100m","long_jump","shot_put","high_jump","400m","110.hurdle","discus","pole_vault","javeline","1500m")
```

$~$

\scriptsize
```{r}
decathlon2.active[c(1,3,4),]
```

---

```{r biplot,eval=T,echo=F,fig.width=7,fig.height=7,out.width="55%",fig.cap=""}
r.prcomp <- prcomp(decathlon2.active, scale=T)

biplot(r.prcomp)
```

### Scree plot

$~$

A graphical description of the **proportion of variance explained (PVE)** by a certain number of PCs (see Fig 12.3 from @ISL):

---

### Proportion of varianced explained (PVE)

$~$

**Recap:** The PVE by PC $m$ is given by 

$$
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^m z_{im}^2} {\sum_{j=1}^p\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij}^2}
$$

# Clustering

$~$

* The aim is to find _clusters_ or _subgroups_.

* Clustering looks for homogeneous subgroups in the data.



$~$

Difference to PCA?

\pause

$\rightarrow$ PCA looks for low-dimensional representation of the data.

### K-means vs. hierarchical clustering

$~$

See menti.com



---

### K-means clustering

$~$

* Fix the number of clusters $K$.

$~$

* Find groups such that the sum of the within-cluster variation is minimized.

$~$

* Algorithm?

### Hierarchical clustering

$~$

Bottom-up agglomerative clustering that results in a _\textcolor{red}{dendogram}_.

$~$

![](hierclust.png){width=90%}

---

### Important in hierarchical clustering

$~$

* _\textcolor{red}{Linkage:}_ Complete, single, average centroid.

$~$

* _\textcolor{red}{Dissimilarity measure:}_ Euclidian distance, correlation. _Other similarity/distance measures?_ \footnote{ Note: Correlation is actually a similarity measure, not a distance measure. Implication?}


---

### Hierarchical clustering -- example

$~$

![](fig12_12.png)

Note: The representation on the right is not possible in high-dimensional space (i.e., if we have $X_1, X_2, X_3, ...., X_p$).

### Hierarchical clustering -- example
